### Hi there 👋

My name is Vinicius Scorza, I started my studies in January 2023 as a self-taught person, studying programming logic and going through some languages such as C, C#, Python, Dart, Ruby and JavaScript

I came from the world of audio, working with theater and with bands.

Tecnologies are awesome and its difficult to me to found something that i don't enjoy in this world

I joined a freelance project working with C# .NET Framework 4.8.1, which made me learn about the amazing .NET ecosystem

Currently, i'm studying Python with Django Framework and Dart with Flutter SDK

I value greate usability, user experience, design thinking, also good code readability!! Clean code is the way!!
