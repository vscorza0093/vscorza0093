### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vinicius, I started my studies in January 2023 as a self-taught person, studying programming logic and going through some languages such as C, C#, Python, Ruby and Java Script

I came from the world of audio, working with theater and with bands.

I love tecnologies and its difficult to me to found something that i don't enjoy

I joined a freelance project working with C# .NET Framework 4.8.1, which made me learn about the amazing .NET ecosystem

I'm currently focusing on learning Python, CSS and Javascript even though I'm also studying C#
